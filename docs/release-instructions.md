# Dependency notes

- `@iarna/toml` has a 3.0 that we have never been on but it was released the same day as the last 2.x https://github.com/BinaryMuse/toml-node/commits/master (needs more investigation)

## List of dependencies that went ESM

- `@sindresorhus/slugify` ESM at 2.x
- `multimatch` is ESM at 6

# Canary Release Procedure

1. npmclean aka `rm -rf node_modules && rm -f package-lock.json && npm install`
1. Make sure `npx ava` runs okay
1. Update version in `package.json`, include `-canary.1` suffix
1. Check it all in and commit
1. Tag new version
1. Before publishing core to npm (if applicable), build and commit a new the `eleventy-edge-cdn` project to generate a new Eleventy Edge lib.
1. `npm publish --access=public --tag=canary`

Unfortunate thing about npm: if you push a 1.0.0-canary.x to `canary` after a `2.0.0-canary.x`, it will use the last pushed tag (not the highest version number)

## If Branch docs already exist, 11ty-website (unlikely, I donâ€™t do this any more)

1. Check to make sure `"prerelease": false` in `_data/config.json`
2. Check to make sure `"prerelease": true` does not exist in current version in `_data/versions.json`
3. Merge branch to master.
