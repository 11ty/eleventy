// Note for future visitors, an attempt was made to separate these plugins the bundle (so that they could be exported separately)
// - HtmlBasePlugin and InputPathToUrl were moved to async in the ResolvePlugin.js adapter.
// - Extended configuration was removed from defaultConfig.js
// This saved ~400KB (unmin) from the bundle but the separate bundle was way larger than the savings (> 1MB)
